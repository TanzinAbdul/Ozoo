# OzZoo - Zoo Simulation Game

A Python OOP-based zoo simulation game demonstrating software engineering principles.

## Project Structure

ozoo/
├── main.py # Entry point
├── core/ # Core interfaces and utilities
├── animals/ # Animal hierarchy and species
├── zoo/ # Zoo management components

## Features

- Object-Oriented Design with inheritance and polymorphism
- Factory Pattern for animal creation
- Interface-based design with ABC
- Custom exception handling
- Modular, extensible architecture

## Running the Game

```bash
python main.py
Development
This project demonstrates:

Strong OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)

Design Patterns (Factory Method)

Exception Handling

Modular Architecture


This skeleton provides:
- ✅ **Complete project structure** with proper packages
- ✅ **Documented classes** with relationship explanations
- ✅ **Placeholder methods** ready for implementation
- ✅ **Factory pattern** structure
- ✅ **Interface definitions** with ABC
- ✅ **Exception hierarchy**
- ✅ **Modular design** for scalability

Ready to start implementing the core functionality! Which module would you like to tackle first?
